                Modify this Django application such that a
                <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1" target="_blank">BED file</a>
                can be uploaded <a href="{% url 'genome:upload' %}">here</a>. The uploader should, at minimum:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-left">
                <li>Save the genomic regions specified in the BED file to database via Django's ORM.</li>
                <li>Render a graphical summary of the regions uploaded.
                    <a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/">plotly.js</a> would be a reasonable tool for this, but use
                    what you like. It's okay if your visualization doesn't seem very "useful," since this may be
                    your first exposure to this kind of data.
                </li>
                <li>Be well tested!</li>

            Example BED files can be found
            <a href="{% static 'genome/BED-examples/example-1.bed' %}" target="_blank">here</a> and
            <a href="{% static 'genome/BED-examples/example-2.bed' %}" target="_blank">here</a>, but know that we'll be
            testing your code with more than just these files! Feel free to modify the existing code however you like,
            so long as the above requirements are met. This is only a starting point.
